# shopping_app
ugly shopping app

add and delete groceries into you shopping list and when you're finally done with it, send a pic of the list to your email. (idk why you would do that)

The user can sign up with google (used gmail api oauth authentication) and then firebase remembers your login details even after you exit the app.
